# SI-SoftwareEvolution
Scientific Initiation with java, to test diferent kinds of deprecated methods, fields and types. This large-scale study aims to suggest depreciation messages to codes where they have been forgotten or do not have this practice.
We use some tools, all of them are from gitHub too, previous studies on the area of software evolution or self made.

### Stuff used to help with the work, all of them have some adaptations to work together with Scripts or no:

 * [RefDiff](https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/RefDiff) find refactoring changes between different versions of Java source code
 * [DeprecatedFinding](https://github.com/gleisonbt/DeprecatedFinding) analyze java code to detect deprecated methods
 * [JDT2Famix](https://github.com/feenkcom/jdt2famix) produce MSE files that can be loaded in moosetechnology.org out of Java code.
 * [Moose](http://moosetechnology.org/) read MSE files from JDT2Famix
 
### Own stuff
 * [ExtractFromFamix](https://github.com/pedromoraesh/IC-SoftwareEvolution/tree/master/Tools/ExtractFromFamix) Self made tool to extract data from .mse file to known format, for future analisys
